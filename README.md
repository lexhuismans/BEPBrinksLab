These are some of the files I wrote during my thesis for the control an inhouse built multimodal voltage imaging microscope. 
I started using Python during my bachelor thesis. Appart from some minor coding experience I had NO experience in Python before this. 

Therefore, the use of Git is also lacking. However, I started using Git together with Github in my master (including my master thesis).
